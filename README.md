# Web Presentation DSL

## File Structure

In `work files`, there are example presentations (currently only 1) that contain
desired input and output.
Within the `example output` folder, there are the output files as HTML, CSS, and
JS files.
The HTML file should be renderable by opening it in the browser (I only tested
in Chrome).
In the `example syntax` folder, the bulk of the example syntax is in the `.pres`
file with basic styling in a separate CSS file.
