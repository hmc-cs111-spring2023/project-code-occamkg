# Web Presentation DSL

## File Structure

In `work files`, there are example presentations (currently only 1) that contain
desired input and output.
Within a presentation folder, there are the output files as HTML, CSS, and JS
files.
The HTML file should be renderable by opening it in the browser (I only tested
in Chrome).
In the `ideal syntax` folder, the bulk of the ideal syntax is in the `.pres`
file with basic styling in a separate CSS file.
